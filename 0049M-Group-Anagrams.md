# 0049M Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.

**Example:**

```
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]
```

**Note:**

- All inputs will be in lowercase.
- The order of your output does not matter.

## List-Hashmap of Sorted-Char Tuples

By [lc-cn-sol](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/group-anagrams/solution/zi-mu-yi-wei-ci-fen-zu-by-leetcode/), we have two methods. The first one is to build a list hashmap with sorted tuple of characters as keys.

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        dic = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for word in strs:
            dic[tuple(sorted(word))].append(word)
        return dic.values()
```

**Result:** runtime 112ms (62%), memory 18MB (38%)

Time $O(NK\log K)$, where $N$ is the length of `strs`, and $K$ is the longest length of `word`.

Space $O(NK)$ 

## List-Hashmap of Char-Frequency Tuples

The second method is to count the frequency of each 26 characters as keys of hashmap. It saves more time because it doesnâ€™t need to sort the characters for each word. 

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        dic = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for word in strs:
            count = [0] * 26
            for char in word:
                count[(ord(char) - ord('a'))] += 1
            dic[tuple(count)].append(word)
        return dic.values()
```

**Result:** runtime 124ms (48%), memory 19MB (5%)

Time $O(NK)$, where $N$ is the length of `strs`, and $K$ is the longest length of `word`.

Space $O(NK)$
