# 0015M - 3Sum

## Description

Given an array `nums` of *n* integers, are there elements *a*, *b*, *c* in `nums` such that *a* + *b* + *c* = 0? Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

**Note:**

The solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

**Example:**

```
Given array nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],

A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]
]
```

Initial code:

```python
def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
```

## Three Pointers - Time Exceeded

We quick-sort `nums` first and then loop three pointers acting as *a*, *b*, and *c*, repsetively. It works but exceeds time due to the $O(n^3)+O(n\log n)$ time complexity. 

```python
triplets = []
nums.sort()
for ia, a in enumerate(nums):
	for ib, b in enumerate(nums[ia+1:]):
		for c in nums[ia+ib+2:]:
			if a + b + c == 0:
				if [a,b,c] not in triplets:
					triplets.append([a,b,c])
                    break
return triplets
```

## Two Pointers - Best

Still, we sort `nums` first, which is $O(n\log n)$. Then, recall the solution of *0001E-Two-Sum*, we can first get the complement of *a*, and then test whether the sum of *b* and *c* is equal to the complement of *a*, which is $O(n^2)$. 

There are lots of ways to improve the computations and comparisons:

* Since the final sum should be zero, then besides all-zero case, there must be negative number(s) and positive number(s) in *a*, *b*, and *c*. We can assume *a* as negative to narrow the scope between *b* and *c*.

* Simply return `{}` when `nums` contains all positve/negative numbers.

* We put two pointers, *b*, next to *a*, and *c*, at the end of `nums`. By this method, we can narrow the possible selections of *b* and *c* from the start/end of the remaining list faster.

    ```
              [-5, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10]
    Fix a:     a
    Move b&c:  a   b->               <-c
    ```

Code:

```python
triplets = []
nums.sort()  
if not nums or nums[0] > 0 or nums[-1] < 0:
    return []
for ia in range(len(nums)):
    if nums[ia] > 0:
        break
    if  ia > 0 and nums[ia] == nums[ia-1]: # prevent duplication
        continue
    complement = 0 - nums[ia]
    ib, ic = ia + 1, len(nums) - 1
    while ib < ic:
        if nums[ib] + nums[ic] == complement:
            triplets.append([nums[ia],nums[ib],nums[ic]])
            while ib < ic and nums[ib] == nums[ib+1]: # prevent duplication
                ib += 1
            while ib < ic and nums[ic] == nums[ic-1]: # prevent duplication
                ic -= 1
            ib += 1
            ic -= 1
        elif nums[ib] + nums[ic] < complement:
            ib += 1
        else:
            ic -= 1
return triplets
```

**Result:** runtime 812ms (85%), memory 17MB (70%).
